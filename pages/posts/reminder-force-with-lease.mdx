According to the Git documentation, the `git push` command "update remote refs along with associated objects". It means that it updates your remote repository based on your local information.

This is just a reminder to myself in the future. Try `git push --force-with-lease` Instead of `git push --force`.

The `git push --force` updates the repository with everything you have locally. **Possibly overwriting** any changes that a team member has pushed in the meantime.
