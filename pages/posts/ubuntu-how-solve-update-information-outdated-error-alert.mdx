You open your computer to finish a task and see a red triangle at the top-right of your screen with the following message:

> The update information is outdated. This may be caused by network problems or by a repository that is no longer available. Please update manually by selecting â€˜Show updatesâ€™ from indicator menu, and watching for any failing repositories.

Since this blog is about the experiences that I get and the problems I solve being a Web Developer, let me help you fix one more problem.

## The problem

Well, the reason for the alert shows is described in the error message: "This may be caused by network problems or by a repository that is no longer available". There are no reasons to be worried, though.

## How to solve

While the reason is self-explanatory, the solution suggested by the error message doesn't work as expected. When you select the Show Updates option, it says that the software is up to date.

To be honest, it does work sometimes. However, you can also do it manually if you want. Just open your terminal and run the command below:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

This command will download and install an updated list of your packages. To understand the difference between the commands `update` and `upgrade`, have a look at this [Ubuntu man page](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/apt-get.8.html).

That's it ðŸ‘‹
